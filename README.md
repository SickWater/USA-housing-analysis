# USA-housing-analysis
A Python project using Linear Regression to analyze housing prices and explore relationships between area features and price. Includes data visualization, model training, evaluation, and cross-validation.

## Overview
This project uses Python and Scikit-Learn to analyze housing data and predict property prices using Linear Regression. The project covers:

- Data exploration and visualization
- Feature selection and preparation
- Training and evaluating a Linear Regression model
- Cross-validation to assess model performance

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- `Avg. Area Income`: Average income of the area
- `Avg. Area House Age`: Average age of houses in the area
- `Avg. Area Number of Rooms`
- `Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms`
- `Area Population`
- `Price`: Target variable (property price)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


##Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/SickWater/USA-housing-analysis.git

2. Open the notebook in jupyter or vs code
3  Run the cells to explore data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

Features

-Descriptive statistics and data visualization
-Correlation heatmaps and pair plots
-Linear Regression model training
-Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, R-squared
-Cross-validation for robust performance evaluation

Credits

This project was created as a learning exercise following Python tutorials. All code has been written and adapted by Jackie Tan, with a few tweaks by SickWater
